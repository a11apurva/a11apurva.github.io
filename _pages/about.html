I am a software engineer working in the database products organization at HPE. I work on the SQL query compiler and the query optimization engine. Till now I have barely scratched the surface of this massive massive domain, but I find it very fascinating and I am trying to dive deeper into it.

I am also excited about research problems involving applied Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I like to look out for opportunities in the enterprise products and services which can benefit using ML. Over past couple of years I have been successful in applying ML to solve a few such problems.

My other interests include robotics, hobby electronics and solving real-life problems using my engineering knowledge. Some of these are documented [here](https://a11apurva.github.io/portfolio/)
