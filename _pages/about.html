<p align='justify'>
Currently, I am pursuing MSc. Computer Science at the University of Southampton. Expected to graduate in September 2023 and I am open to new opportunities.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
Previously, I was a software engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I worked on HPE's mission-critical NonStop SQL/MX, a massively parallel, distributed, and fault-tolerant database system. 
</p>

<p align='justify'>
I worked at HPE for 4 years, specializing in the development of large-scale software products while adhering to agile development methodologies. I am a collaborative team player with the ability to lead modules independently. I am enterprising and have a track record of producing innovative solutions, proof-of-concepts (PoCs), and papers. My strengths lie in my ability to understand customer requirements, translate them into high-level designs, and produce high-quality applications that not only fulfil the needs of users but also contribute to a positive user experience.

<p align='justify'>
I am also excited about research problems involving applied Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My other interests include robotics, hobby electronics and solving real-life problems using my engineering knowledge. Some of these are documented <a href='https://a11apurva.github.io/portfolio/'>here</a>
