I am working as a software engineer for the database products at HPE. To be more specific I work on the SQL query compiler and the query optimization engine. While I am not an expert in DB internals, I am learning and developing myself towards it.

I also have keen interest in applied Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I like to look out for opportunities in the enterprise products and services which can benefit using ML. Over past couple of years I have been successful in applying ML to solve a few such problems.

My other interests include robotics, hobby electronics and solving real-life problems using my engineering knowledge. Some of these are documented [here](https://a11apurva.github.io/portfolio/)

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
